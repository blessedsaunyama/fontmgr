Venue Font
This font was inspired by the font used to display the course venue in the racing game F-Zero GX.
Use CAPSLOCK when typing. Small caps are included for typing in lowercase.
Outline versions are also included.

How to recreate the venue font look:
Choose the F-Zero GX Venue Font-Semi Light Oblique font.
Add a vertical gradient with white (#FFFFFF) at the top blending into cyan (#C6FFFF) at the bottom.
Add an outer stroke.
The stroke layers are made up of 3 layers with the innermost and outermost layers being twice as thick as the center stroke layer.
Each stroke layer also has a separate opacity strength:
	First stroke layer color #444444 (40% thickness) (71% opacity)
	Second stroke layer color #99AABB (20% thickness) (57% opacity)
	Third stroke layer color #224455 (40% thickness) (43% opacity)

Menu Font
This font was inspired by the font used in various places in the menu titles.
Several alternate lowercase letterforms are included for the Menu Font: a, b, e, g, h, i, j, k, n, r, v, y, z
